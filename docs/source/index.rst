The Chromophile color maps
==========================

The Chromophile color maps are a tool for data visualization.
They are intended for accurate visualization of continuous data
on a linear scale.  Like all color maps, they are used to convert
data into colors, and these colors are applied to swatches or
glyphs in the final visualization.

This documentation consists of two parts.  The user guide
describes how to use the Chromophile color maps.  The rest of the
documentation describes how the Chromophile color maps were
designed.
