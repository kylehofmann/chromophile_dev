Implementation notes
====================

The project was implemented in Python :cite:p:`Python`.  The
implementation, being research code, was not really designed; it
grew on its own like some sort of benign tumor.  It would benefit
from being rewritten from scratch (for a third time), but there
are no plans for that.

Others are welcome to use the software.  The implementation is
available at `<https://github.com/kylehofmann/chromophile_dev/>`_.
However, you are warned that it is self-documenting in the
pejorative sense: the only documentation is the source code.  The
author expects that in a few years, he will no longer quite
remember how to use it himself.
